### Hey, I'm Adarsh Shah 👋

I like to build things for the web and is currently into front-end <del>designing</del> development. :scream::relaxed:

A year from now when surfing through varoius websites, i had been wondering and applauding :astonished: about the stunning animation and the ui interface those websites had and then on i started digging on it :runner:.From then on my journey started as a web developer and switched to front-end.
Till today i am living and breathing web development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces and helping make this world better through design and code.

I am always trying to grow and learn something new. I loose track of time while building something new. :muscle::dizzy:

> “A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.”
