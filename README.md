### Hey, I'm Adarsh Shah <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I like to build things for the web and is currently into front-end <del>designing</del> development. :scream::relaxed:

On some days when I was surfing various websites, I found myself admiring the stunning :astonished: animations and user interfaces. I began to research how they were created :runner: and my journey as a web developer began and eventually, I transitioned into front-end development.

Till today i am living and breathing web development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces and helping make this world better through design and code.

I am always trying to grow and learn something new. I loose track of time while building something new. :muscle::dizzy:

> “A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.”
